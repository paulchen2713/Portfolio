## **Summary**
I received my Master's degree in **Communications Engineering** from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), under the guidance of Professor Wei-Ho Chung. My research is primarily dedicated to solving optimization challenges in practical RIS-assisted MU-MISO mmWave systems, applying the **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** algorithm of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) along with the conventional **communications algorithm** of Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT). In addition, my earlier research endeavors encompass **radar target detection**, **computer vision**, and **edge AI**. Notably, I developed a custom YOLOv3 model from scratch, showcasing my capability to innovate and implement advanced technological solutions.


## **Job hunting**
I am actively seeking **entry-level** positions in Hsinchu, Zhubei, and Zhunan. While I have a focused interest in embedded **firmware**, system **software**, and **AI/DSP/communications** algorithms, I am open to exploring all potential opportunities, regardless of their direct alignment with my academic background. 
I am a keen and passionate learner, equipped to quickly adapt and excel in fast-paced environments, mastering necessary skills and knowledge along the way.
