## **Summary**
I received my Master’s degree in Communications Engineering from NTHU in May 2024. My research primarily focuses on solving optimization challenges in communication systems, and my earlier research endeavors include radar target detection, computer vision, and edge AI.

I am working full-time at ITRI as a software engineer, designing real-time baseband algorithms for 5G NR and developing hardware-dependent DSP code that runs on our custom-designed RISC-V processors. 


<!-- ## **Job hunting**
I am seeking **entry-level** positions in Hsinchu, Zhubei, and Zhunan. While I have a focused interest in embedded **firmware**, system **software**, and **AI/DSP/communications** algorithms, I am open to exploring all potential opportunities, regardless of their direct alignment with my academic background. 
I am a keen and passionate learner, equipped to quickly adapt and excel in fast-paced environments, mastering necessary skills and knowledge along the way. -->
